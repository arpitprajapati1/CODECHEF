P1
Increasing COVID cases have created panic amongst the people of Chefland, so the government is starting to push for production of a vaccine. It has to report to the media about the exact date when vaccines will be available.

There are two companies which are producing vaccines for COVID. Company A starts producing vaccines on day D1 and it can produce V1 vaccines per day. Company B starts producing vaccines on day D2 and it can produce V2 vaccines per day. Currently, we are on day 1.

We need a total of P vaccines. How many days are required to produce enough vaccines? Formally, find the smallest integer d such that we have enough vaccines at the end of the day d.

Input
The first and only line of the input contains five space-separated integers D1, V1, D2, V2 and P.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest required number of days.

Example Output 1
3
Explanation
Since D1=D2=1, we can produce V1+V2=5 vaccines per day. In 3 days, we produce 15 vaccines, which satisfies our requirement of 14 vaccines.

Example Output 2
9
Explanation
There are 0 vaccines produced on the first day, 10 vaccines produced on each of days 2, 3 and 4, and 14 vaccines produced on the fifth and each subsequent day. In 9 days, it makes a total of 0+10⋅3+14⋅5=100 vaccines.

Finally, a COVID vaccine is out on the market and the Chefland government has asked you to form a plan to distribute it to the public as soon as possible. There are a total of N people with ages a1,a2,…,aN.

There is only one hospital where vaccination is done and it is only possible to vaccinate up to D people per day. Anyone whose age is ≥80 or ≤9 is considered to be at risk.On each day, you may not vaccinate both a person who is at risk and a person who is not at risk. Find the smallest number of days needed to vaccinate everyone.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D.
The second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN.

Explanation
Example case 1: We do not need to worry about how the people are grouped, since only one person can be vaccinated in a single day. We require as many days as there are people.
Example case 2: There are two people at risk and three people who are not at risk. One optimal strategy is to vaccinate the two people at risk on day 1 and the remaining three on the next 2 days.

Example Input

3 3
2 2 3
Example Output
0 0 3
Explanation
Example case 1: The original sequence is (2,2,3). Consider the following three operations:

Choose i=1, j=2 and p=1. Then, A1 changes from 2 to 2⊕21=0 and similarly, A2 changes from 2 to 2⊕21=0. Now the sequence is (0,0,3).
Next, choose i=1, j=2 and p=1. Then, A1 changes to 0⊕21=2 and A2 changes to 0⊕21=2. The sequence is (2,2,3).
Next, again choose i=1, j=2 and p=1. Then, A1 changes to 2⊕21=0 and A2 changes to 2⊕21=0. The sequence is (0,0,3) again.
We can check that after exactly 3 operations, this is the lexicographically smallest sequence we can obtain.





You are given a rooted tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and a prime number P. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree and for each v (2≤v≤N), the parent of vertex v is pv (pv<v).

A vertex s is an ancestor of another vertex f if s lies on the path between 1 and f (in particular, f is its own ancestor). For two vertices u and v, let's define LCA(u,v) as the vertex s with the largest number which is an ancestor of both u and v. Similarly, for two vertices v and s, let Lv,s be the set of all vertices u such that s=LCA(u,v).

Let's define a set AP containing all sequences (indexed from 1) with length N whose elements are integers between 0 and P−1 inclusive. For two sequences a,b∈AP, let's define an operation LCA-convolution as a sequence c=a∗b such that for each valid x,
cx=(∑i=1N∑j∈Li,xaibj)modP.
You are also given some sequence c∈AP. You have two tasks:

Find the number of sequences a∈AP such that c=a∗a. Since this number can be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.
Find a sequence a∈AP such that c=a∗a (if it exists).
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and P.
The second line contains N−1 space-separated integers p2,p3,…,pN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers c1,c2,…,cN.
Output
For each test case, print two lines:

The first of these lines should contain a single integer ― the number of sequences from the first task modulo 998,244,353.
If there is no sequence a∈AP such that c=a∗a, the second line should contain the integer −1.
Otherwise, the second line should contain N space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aN, where a∈AP and c=a∗a should hold. If there is more than one such sequence, you may find any one of them.

Two strings A and B are equivalent (denoted by A(XOR)B) if they have the same lengths and A can be transformed into B by performing the following operation zero or more times: choose a substring of A which contains '1' an even number of times and reverse this substring.

You are given a binary string S. Find the number of different equivalence classes of the substrings of this string.
